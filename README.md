Quiz yourself on the JavaScript `this` keyword!

1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:1234`
1. You should see 6 buttons. Before clicking each one, read the code in `index.js` to see if you can predict the outcome! Hint: Babel adds the `"use strict"` directive by default, that may affect the value of `this`.
